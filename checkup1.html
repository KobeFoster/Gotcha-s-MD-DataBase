  <fieldset class="patient_Analysis">PATIENT ANALYSIS: The patient was generally in context to the sections of this checkup that were rather healthy and showed high cognitive, vision and general physical capabilities when it comes to completing exercise, they were able to understand such that I have said and followed such to the highest of standards. The patient displayed overall well health and mental capacity, while there are some outlined qualities suggesting they are overall healthy, there are some areas of concern to consider. The patient has an extremely low weight that is to be expected of someone of that height, coming in at 90.0LBS LBS | 40.82 KG, which is not something you should be seeing with such a patient, it‚Äôs quite an area that should be concerned and responded to immediately.
    Treating such is rather simple, but may take a while to achieve, the patient should be consuming more high-calorie dense food and consuming more protein in they‚Äôre general diet. If the patient continues to have said record weight, than a further discussion and health checkup may need to be considered to be able to better monitor health and be able to combat any underlying causes of such happening.

  <fieldset class="patient_Analysis">PATIENT ANALYSIS: <p>As per the above infomation shown, the patient did rather well in regards to basic health, the patient completed the memory phrase, eye exam and physical test to the expected standards however that does not mean that they were able to successfully complete all sections without flaw. The patient had a weight of 179 lbs and compared to height may not make them the most fit person, I would sugegst for said patient to be able to do regular exercise to stay in shape at acceptable standard. Not only this they also made a msitake with provided question, while it was only one number off in regards to how many letters are in the english alphabet, they stated 25 which is not correct, but this can be a common mistake and wasen't so far off from 26. All in all, the patient did rather well in regards to their overall health. If follow up is requested I will do such.</p></fieldset>
