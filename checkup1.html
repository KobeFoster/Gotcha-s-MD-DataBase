  <fieldset class="patient_Analysis">PATIENT ANALYSIS: <p>As per the above infomation shown, the patient did rather well in regards to basic health, the patient completed the memory phrase, eye exam and physical test to the expected standards however that does not mean that they were able to successfully complete all sections without flaw. The patient had a weight of 179 lbs and compared to height may not make them the most fit person, I would sugegst for said patient to be able to do regular exercise to stay in shape at acceptable standard. Not only this they also made a msitake with provided question, while it was only one number off in regards to how many letters are in the english alphabet, they stated 25 which is not correct, but this can be a common mistake and wasen't so far off from 26. All in all, the patient did rather well in regards to their overall health. If follow up is requested I will do such.</p></fieldset>
